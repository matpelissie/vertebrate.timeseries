# Introduction

According to the latest WWF report, the average population size of terrestrial 
vertebrates has fallen by 68%  In less than 50 years(WWF, 2020). However, 
recent studies have even suggested that the dynamics of biodiversity are not 
really declining on average. They postulate that species at risk are dragging 
down global indices (Leung et al., 2020), but that there are as many "winners" 
as "losers" species in total (Dornelas et al., 2019). These last results have
mainly been documented through the BioTIME database (Dornelas et al., 2018).
In this report, we propose to re-evaluate this through the Living Planet 
Database. We also aim to investigate whether  population  dynamics are
influenced  by  climate change.


# Population data

## Methods

The database considered contains 1212 species of terrestrial vertebrates and
5529 population time series distributed worldwide. We only focused on time 
series beginning after 1980 in order to be consistent with the climate data 
we analyse in the following part.

Each  population  time  series  was  fitted  with  a  linear regression  model  to  quantify  the  trend  through:

\begin{eqnarray*} 
X(t) = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}t + \epsilon(t)
\end{eqnarray*}

Where $X$  is the abundance estimate, $t$ the time in years, with process error 
represented by $\epsilon$ ~ $N$(0,$\sigma$²).

## Results

The following map illustrates the distribution of the time series. Each 
point is colored according to its trend and sized according to the magnitude of
its trend.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# colours
Col<-c('#abdda4','#fdae61')

# plot the trends (colored and sized by slope)
points<-drawWorld()+
  geom_point(data=LPI.mod,
             aes(x=long, y=lat, color=slope<0,size=abs(slope)),
             alpha=I(0.7))+
  scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,5))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold.italic"),
        legend.position="bottom") +
  guides(size = "none") +
  scale_colour_manual(name="Slope", labels = c("increase", "decrease"), values= Col)+
  labs(title="Figure 1: Terrestrial vertebrates population  declines and  increases  worldwide. ")
points
```

Among the 5529 populations, `r sum(LPI.mod$slope_p<0.05 & LPI.mod$slope>0)` are
increasing, `r sum(LPI.mod$slope_p<0.05 & LPI.mod$slope<0)` are decreasing and 
`r sum(LPI.mod$slope_p>=0.05)` are showing constant trends (p>0.05).
