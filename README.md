# vertebrate.timeseries

The aim of this project is to assess the impact of some aspects of climate change on terrestrial vertebrates dynamics. To do so, we combined two databases, one containing population time series (Living Planet Database) and the other with fine-scale monthly temperature (CHELSA Climate), both are worldwide datasets.  

The main idea is to make use of tools improving the reproductibility of this analysis exposed during the formation [link](https://rdatatoolbox.github.io/)

## Are populations facing the highest temperature increases also the more declining?
